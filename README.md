## Introduction

This is a demo project that uses [JSON Server](https://my-json-server.typicode.com/) to create a fake REST API for
prototyping and testing.

To accomplish this, the following steps were taken:

1. Created this repository
2. Added a `db.json` file with some data
3. Automatically deployed to <https://my-json-server.typicode.com/noclocks/demo-jsonserver>

## Project Structure

> [!NOTE]
> Note that this project implements the deployment above while also providing a local development environment.

The project structure is as follows:

- [`db.json`](./db.json): A JSON file that contains the data for the fake REST API.
- [`package.json`](./package.json): A Node.js package file that contains the dependencies and scripts for the project.
